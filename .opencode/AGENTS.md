# AGENTS.md

Agent instructions for this repository only. A root `AGENTS.md` would sit at
`~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` and load into every session in every project, so
this file lives in `.opencode/` and `.opencode/opencode.json` names it under
`instructions`, which OpenCode reads only inside this repository.

## Version Control

Commit only when explicitly asked, push only when explicitly asked, and "commit"
does not imply "push". No `Co-Authored-By` trailer.

## Task Tracking

Work of more than one step keeps the todo tool current, one item in progress and
each ticked off as it finishes, so a human can follow along.

## Browser Slots

Every OpenCode process drives its own Chrome profile, and `CHROME_SLOT` in the
shell names it. Chrome processes of another slot belong to another OpenCode
window: never kill, close or reuse them. Kill only processes whose command line
carries `opencode-profile-` followed by the value of `CHROME_SLOT`, and refuse
when that variable is unset.

## Output Formatting

Pad every cell of a markdown table so all cells of a column share one width.
The em dash is reserved for interrupted dialogue and a genuine break in
thought; everywhere else use the specific mark. American spelling in code,
comments and English prose.
